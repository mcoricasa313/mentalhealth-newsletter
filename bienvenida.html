          Greetings in the grace and peace of our Lord!
          <br />
          <br />
          With heartfelt joy and gratitude I welcome you to our daily reading
          plan and devotionals, aptly named “Your Words Were Found.”
          <br />
          As we stand at the threshold of this spiritual journey, I am deeply
          moved by the unity and purpose that bind us together. Our shared
          commitment to delve into the Word of God is not just an individual
          pursuit, but a collective voyage that strengthens our faith, deepens
          our understanding, and enhances our fellowship. In the coming year, as
          we traverse through the scriptures, let each day be a revelation of
          God’s profound love and wisdom. “Your Words Were Found” is designed to
          not only guide you through the Bible but also to provide meaningful
          reflections that resonate with our daily lives. It is my earnest
          prayer that this journey enriches your walk with God and illuminates
          your path with His truth and righteousness. Remember, you are not
          alone in this endeavor. We are a community, a family in Christ,
          embarking together on this enlightening path. Your insights,
          questions, and reflections are valuable, and I encourage you to share
          them with our community. Let us support, inspire, and learn from one
          another as we walk together in faith. I am immensely thankful for your
          decision to join us in this year-long commitment to Scripture. May
          this journey bring you closer to God and to each other, as we discover
          the treasures hidden in His Word. May God bless you abundantly as we
          embark on this spiritual adventure together.
          <br />
          With warm regards and prayers,
          <br />
